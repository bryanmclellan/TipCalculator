# TipCalculator 

This is a simple tip calculator app that allows that user to input his/her bill amount and then will calculate the tip and total 
cost from that. The settings scene allows the user to input a percentage that will be used as the default percentage when the user
hits "back" and recalculates their total and tip. It always provides the user with three percentage options. The first of which is
default value that can be changed, and the other two are always 20% and 22%.

Time spent: two and a half hours
